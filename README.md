#  RenewaLearn  
## Capstone Project for Code Kentucky Web Development Course 2

## Built by Ryan Cornett

### Project Description:
The RenewaLearn website enables delivery of custom quizzes to adult education students who attend HyFlex classes remotely. This allows our program's participants to independently practice skills learned in virtual classes on their laptops, desktops, and/or mobile devices with questions curated by their adult education instructors for a personal touch not available on ready-made sites, thus extending the flexible and supportive learning environment carefully curated by program instructors and counselors.  
HyFlex is designed to offer a flexible and accessible learning experience to students who have busy schedules or prefer the convenience of virtual learning. This pilot initiative--built by our consortium of four Kentucky county programs--is the first in the state to offer a comprehensive variety of courses available both online and in-person. Students may choose to attend virtual classes, in-person classes, view classes remotely from their local center, or watch recordings of previous classes at their own pace. HyFlex caters to the diverse learning needs of adult students, and its hybrid approach allows students to customize their learning experience to suit their individual preferences. Staffed by experienced instructors who provide engaging and interactive instruction and are committed to helping students achieve their academic and professional goals, HyFlex is sure to be an integral part of adult education going forward.

### Features List:
1. Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app: *user's name and quiz score* (FEATURE LIST 1)
2. Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it (in all cases prevent invalid input from being stored or saved): *user's name and email* (FEATURE LIST 1)
3. Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app: *Word of the Day from Wordnik* (FEATURE LIST 2)
4. Implement modern interactive UI features: *calendar date picker that appears after successful name and email submission; modals* (FEATURE LIST 3)  
5. Create a node.js web server using a modern framework such as Express.js or Fastify. Serve at least one route that
your app uses (must serve more than just the index.html file): *Express.js serves /quiz objects* (FEATURE LIST 3)
